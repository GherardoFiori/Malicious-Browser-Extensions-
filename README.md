![Malicious Extensions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GherardoFiori/MaliciousBrowserExtensions/main/count.json)
# Overview

This repository consolidates malicious browser extensions identified through:
- Independent security research
- Public incident disclosures
- Security blogs and threat intelligence reports
- Verified media investigations

All CRX samples collected here are used to train and evaluate the AI detection engine behind ExterminAI.
The objective is to centralize fragmented research into a structured dataset for analysis and model development.

# Purpose

This dataset enables:
- Static analysis of malicious extension code
- Permission abuse pattern analysis
- Study of obfuscation and payload injection techniques
- Behavioral modeling for detection systems
- Benchmarking AI-based classification models

The IDs of the browser extensions found in this database are retrivered by news articles realted to Malicious Browser Extensions such as: 

https://thehackernews.com/
https://layerxsecurity.com/
https://securelist.com/
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/

Blogs and many more.
