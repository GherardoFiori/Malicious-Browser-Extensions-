# Overview

This repository consolidates malicious browser extensions identified through:
- Independent security research
- Public incident disclosures
- Security blogs and threat intelligence reports
- Verified media investigations

All CRX samples collected here are used to train and evaluate the AI detection engine behind ExterminAI.
The objective is to centralize fragmented research into a structured dataset for analysis and model development.

# Purpose

This dataset enables:
- Static analysis of malicious extension code
- Permission abuse pattern analysis
- Study of obfuscation and payload injection techniques
- Behavioral modeling for detection systems
- Benchmarking AI-based classification models

⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains malicious software samples.
They are provided strictly for:

- Research
- Detection model development
- Educational analysis

Do not install these extensions in a production browser environment.
Use isolated VMs or sandboxed analysis environments only.

🔐 Legal & Ethical Notice
